# MSBuild.Solution.Sdk

## Summary

Supports creating MSBuild solutions which are MSBuild projects that indicate what projects to include when building your tree.
They are an evolution of Visual Studio solution files.

### Package Name: `MSBuild.Solution.Sdk`

### Getting started (VS 15.6+)

Visual Studio 2017 Update 6 (aka _v15.6_) includes support for SDK's resolved from NuGet. That makes using the custom SDKs much easier.

#### Using the SDK

1. Create a new project
    - from `dotnet new` templates.
    - With your existing SDK-style project.

2. Replace `Microsoft.NET.Sdk` with `MSBuild.Solution.Sdk` to the project's top-level `Sdk` attribute.

3. You have to tell MSBuild that the `Sdk` should resolve from NuGet by
    - Adding a `global.json` containing the SDK name and version.
    - Appending a version info to the `Sdk` attribute value.

4. Remove the `TargetFramework(s)` and other .NET specific properties from the project file. Older versions of VS IDE might require `TargetFramework(s)` property to open the project in IDE successfully.

5. Then you can add properties, items, tasks and targets to customize your solution to your needs.

The final project should look like this:

```xml
<Project Sdk="MSBuild.Solution.Sdk">

    <PropertyGroup>
        <SolutionName>eShopSolution</SolutionName>
        <RootNamespace>Contoso.eShop</RootNamespace>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <!-- Projects under the solution directory are automatically included -->
    <ItemGroup>
      <!-- Project Folders are also supported! -->
      <ProjectFolder Include="Tools\Build\"/>
      <ProjectFolder Include="Tools\Common\"/>
      <ProjectFolder Include="Tools\Publish\"/>
    </ItemGroup>

    <!-- For projects outside of solution you can include it like soâ€¦ -->
    <ItemGroup Condition="Exists('$(RepoRoot)..\eShopTests\')">
      <ProjectFile Include="$(RepoRoot)..\eShopTests\**\*.*proj"/>
      <ProjectFolder Include="$(RepoRoot)..\eShopTests\ConsoleTests\"/>
    </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

You can put the `global.json` file next to your solution:

```json
{
    "msbuild-sdks": {
        "MSBuild.Solution.Sdk": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

Then, all of your project files, from that directory forward, uses the version from the `global.json` file.
This would be a preferred solution for all the projects in your solution.

Then again, you might want to override the version for just one project _OR_ if you have only one project in your solution (without adding `global.json`), you can do so like this:

```xml
<Project Sdk="MSBuild.Solution.Sdk/1.0.0">

    <PropertyGroup>
        <SolutionName>eShopSolution</SolutionName>
        <RootNamespace>Contoso.eShop</RootNamespace>
    </PropertyGroup>

    <!-- Other properties, items and targets -->

</Project>
```

That's it. You do not need to specify any default properties or items as they'll be automatically defined.
After that, you can use the `Restore`, `Build`, `Pack` targets to restore packages, build the solution and create NuGet packages. E.g.: `msbuild -t:Pack ...`

#### Important to Note

- It will only work with Visual Studio IDE (Windows/Mac) as it requires the desktop `msbuild` and the target Platform SDKs which are not cross-platform.
- It might work in Visual Studio Code, but you have to configure build tasks in `launch.json` to use desktop `msbuild` to build.
- You must install the tools of the platforms you intend to build. For Xamarin, that means the Xamarin Workload; for UWP install those tools as well.
