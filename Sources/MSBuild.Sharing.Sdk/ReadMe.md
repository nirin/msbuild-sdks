## Summary

Supports creating Shared projects that contain properties and items which are shared between multiple projects.
But they themselves remain a separate non-interactive project in the solution tree.

### Getting started

Visual Studio v15.6+ includes support for SDK's resolved from NuGet.
That makes using the custom SDKs much easier.

See [Using MSBuild project SDKs][msbuild-sdk-usage] guide on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.ms) for more information on how project SDKs work and [how project SDKs are resolved][msbuild-sdk-resolver].
