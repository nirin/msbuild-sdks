		These imports will enable restoration of a project's build references from NuGet packages.
		Keep in mind that the restore needs to work just before all the build references are resolved.
		So, import this targets file before all the build-specific imports within a project file.
		NOTE:
		When importing this file, also import Extensions props which inturn imports 'Directory.Packages.props'
		from above the project directory which enables central versioning of multiple projects' dependencies.
